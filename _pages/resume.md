# Experience

**Research Assistant in AI Robotics**  
*Concordia University*  
Sep 2021 -- Dec 2023  
Montréal, Canada

- Automating Satellite Tracking with two data-driven methods:
  - **Deep Learning Method**: Introduced an original DNN-based Visual Servoing method, demonstrating a 32% reduction in pose error and a 22% improvement in velocity precision compared to conventional methods. [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/YN21YdWbZBo?feature=share)
  - **Optimization Method**: Optimized a novel image feature function to reduce motion coupling in visual servoing, achieving an 87% improvement in decoupling efficiency.
- **Novel Dataset Generation Method**: Specific for pose estimation, creating a benchmark dataset of 600K+ synthetic and real data and employing DBSCAN for outlier removal. [video](https://youtu.be/bw6qgphflkY)

**Intern -- Robotic Software Developer**  
[RoboDK](https://robodk.com/)  
May 2022 -- Sep 2022  
Montréal, Canada

- Developed two **RoboDK software Add-ins**:
  - **Real-time IBVS**: Successfully tracking 2D markers using a robotic manipulator, providing an automation feature to the software.
  - **3D Reconstruction using RGB-D cameras**: Retrieving point clouds and creating meshes to make 3D replicas of items.
- Developed an automatic bin filling algorithm, serving as a base for object pose estimation and bin picking algorithms.
